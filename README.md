# Colorizer
This Python script can turn any black and white or vintage picture into a colorized format. It uses pre-trained models from the richzhang/colorization repository.

## Requirements
This script requires the following packages and pre-trained models to run:

cv2
numpy
urllib.request
colorization_deploy_v2.prototxt
colorization_release_v2.caffemodel
## Usage
To use the script, simply run the colorizer.py file and provide the path to your black and white or vintage picture as a command line argument. For example:

<pre><code>
python colorizer.py path/to/your/picture.jpg
</code></pre>
The script will save the colorized version of your picture in the same directory as the original picture, with the suffix _colorized.
